The schematic is just below. The screen is powered via a +5v supply, using SPI communication (MOSI / MISO / CLK / CS).
<br/>
Each button has an integrated LED that can be powered by an IO as LED are not drawning that much current.
<br/>
Lastly, the piezo buzzer is driven via a PWM signal only.
<br/>
<br/>
Prior to order all components, I had this kind of schematic in mind. You need to be very careful about the current
consummed by each parts and if your USB supply is enough to power up everything. Of course USB standard can be powerful
enough to power all these components but what matters is the USB chip use on this specific discovery board. I made
all the calculation in advance so I knew it should not be a problem, even with the display with all its LEDs on.
<br/>
<br/>
The only part I was blind is if LEDs inside the buttons will be visible enough to be powered directly by GPIO of the
STM32 MCU. I was one of the first try when i received components. Plan be would have been to design a small dedicated
circuit for that otherwise.
