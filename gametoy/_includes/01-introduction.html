For several months, I had been planning a fun and educational project, particularly aimed at young children. My goal
was to combine electronics, software, and woodworking into a creative endeavor.
<br/>
Inspired by ideas found online, I wanted to design something achievable within my timeframe that would also look
attractive and function seamlessly.
<br/>
<br/>
The final idea was to build a box featuring several illuminated buttons (4 to 6), a dot matrix screen for simple
displays, and some software to enable games like a reaction test or a memory game (similar to Simon).
<br/>
The idea of adding a piezo buzzer for sound effects came later and enhanced the experience.
<br/>
<br/>
I aimed for a polished final product, avoiding the unfinished look common in DIY projects. I also leveraged access
to a Kick Assembly Line (KAL) at my company, <a href="https://www.kickmaker.fr/">Kickmaker</a>, to use professional
tools for fabrication.
