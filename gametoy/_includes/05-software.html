If you want to have a look at the code, try to compile it and play with it. The best way is simply to follow the
README on the gametoy project page.
<br/>
I have been working on Windows, however, it's probably working on Linux or MacOS as well.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a different board than mine, you'll have to do some adjustments on the pinout to make it work (mostly
in the dts file overlay), it should not be very complicated.
<br/>
<br/>
If you found any issue, have any remarks, feel free to open an issue and / or create a pull request with interesting
features to add.
<br/>
The rest of this chapter explain the philosophy, how I have worked so far to build this software. If you have a
similar project using zephyr, I hope you can find inspiration to help you develop with this RTOS.

To start working with Zephyr RTOS, follow these steps:
<ol>
    <li>Create a working directory.</li>
    <li>Install the Zephyr environment by following the
        <a href="https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html" target="_blank">Getting
            Started Guide</a>.</li>
    <li>Create a new project named <code>gametoy</code> and copy the <code>samples/basic/blinky</code> project into it.</li>
</ol>
This initial step ensures that we can compile and flash a board by making an LED blink.
At this point, we can begin developing and validating each function of our game using a breadboard and Dupont wires,
avoiding the need for soldering.

When compiling, we use the keyword <code>stm32f051</code>, which refers to a specific target. A target may consist
of multiple boards (a main board and a daughter board). Each target in Zephyr has a directory with a DTS file that
defines its hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Since we are using a breadboard and adding new components (screen, buttons, LEDs, buzzer), we can create a new target
or use an overlay file to extend the base DTS configuration. This is especially useful for development kits, as it
allows us to add connections without modifying the hardware itself.

The driver for the MAX7219 already exists in Zephyr. This chip controls an 8x8 dot matrix, and multiple units can be
chained together. I used a pre-assembled screen with four MAX7219 chips connected via SPI:

The screen is powered by 5V, which is conveniently provided by the development kit.

Each button has two pins: one connected to ground and the other to a GPIO pin. Pressing the button connects the
signal to ground, a common mechanism for buttons. Here is the overlay configuration for five buttons:

The piezo buzzer is controlled using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). A square wave signal at a specific frequency
determines the note played, while the duty cycle controls volume.

To organize my source code, I created a <code>lib</code> folder where I store reusable macro software components.
For example, I developed a component called <code>gtp_sound</code> that allows me to generate sounds, beeps, and
full melodies. This component can be used by any other module or game to add sound effects.
<br/>
<br/>
An additional advantage of this structure is the ability to create a dedicated test program to refine and validate
this software module.
<br/>
<br/>
On the right, you can find a small diagram of all software components. Starting from bottom to top, the blue ones
are already developed on Zephyr RTOS.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, you have three components to deal with buttons, display and sounds. The gametoy project is really only dealing
with these 3 main features.
<br/>
<br/>
On top of that, I have design two module, menu and game because all games have things in common (useful functions,
how to quit a game, how to display points, etc...). All games must appear on the menu when the product starts.

To create music, sounds, I have integrated a
<a href="https://www.az-delivery.de/fr/products/buzzer-modul-passiv" target="_blank">piezo buzzer</a>. You need to
feed this component with a PWM (pulse width modulation) signal.
<br/>
Each tone is a different frequency, if you play the exact frequency for the expected amount of time, you can reproduce
a lot of different sounds.
<br/>
<br/>
First, i tried some arduino code I found on
<a href="https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs/blob/master/gameofthrones/gameofthrones.ino" target="_blank">github</a>,
This was not fully working as my hardware is not able to play pwm at a lower frequency than 740Hz.
<br/>
<br/>
I kept the header with all predefined tones and asked chatgpt to generate me some basic melody such as merry christmas.
I did not use the audio result because you could barely guess it was merry christmas. Some notes were completely wrong.
LLM are quite good sometimes but in autumn 2024, they were not really good to generate a music in your code.

        <div class="row customchapter">
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6" style="align-self: center !important;">
Lastly, I simply find the music partition online and manually code the notes and duration I heard. I ended up with
a code similar to that.
<br/>
<br/>
For the resulting audio, please have a look at the video at the bottom of this page.

The biggest constraint is RAM usage. The STM32F0 has only 8KB of RAM, so careful software design is needed to avoid
running out of memory.
<br/>
<br/>
The following optimization strategies were used:
<ul>
    <li>Minimizing the number of threads. Currently, there are only four:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>One thread for LED management (especially blinking).</li>
        <li>One thread for handling the display.</li>
        <li>One thread for Zephyr work (used for button press callbacks).</li>
        <li>The main thread handles everything else, including games and music.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Since all games run in the main thread, mutex-based mechanisms ensure proper execution control.</li>
</ul>
While this design is efficient, it results in a less elegant <code>main.c</code>, which some purists might critique.
<br/>
<br/>
New games can be created easily using the same principles, allowing creativity in game design.
